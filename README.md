# protein_folding_datasets

  This work presents datasets for the Protein Folding Problem (PFP), they consist in data of folding trajectories obtained by an in silico method.
  Three datasets are introduced in this paper, where one is based on the Fibonacci sequence (13FIBO) and the other two on biological sequences (2GB1 and 1PCY). Each dataset is composed of 1000 different trajectories data, which contains information on the structures of the protein during the folding process. In addition, it is also present the energy and radius rotation values for each structure.
All datasets proposed in this work are available in https://mega.nz/#F!O4wBHQiB!mpM81jK9ycbSKPvdP57avw
